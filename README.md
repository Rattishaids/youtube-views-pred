# **🌟 Why This Project Stands Out**
This project showcases a blend of **front-end development, data science, and API integration skills**, demonstrating my ability to:

* **Build responsive, user-friendly interfaces** with modern web technologies.
* **Apply data science concepts** like time series forecasting in a client-side environment.
* **Create engaging visualizations** to communicate insights effectively.
* **Deliver a polished, production-ready application** with attention to UX and design.

It reflects my passion for combining technical expertise with creative design, making it a perfect example of my ability to tackle complex problems and deliver impactful solutions.

# **✨ Key Features**

* **Channel Analytics** 📈: Fetch real-time channel stats (**subscribers, video count, total views**) via the **YouTube Data API**.
* **View Forecasting** 🔮: Predict future views for the next **7 days** using simplified **ARIMA** and **Prophet-like models**.
* **Historical Trends** 📅: Visualize historical view patterns with **interactive line charts**.
* **Video Insights** 🎬: Display recent videos with view counts, upload dates, and daily view rates in a sleek table.
* **Modern UI** 🎨: Responsive design with gradients, animations, and a purple-blue-red color palette.
* **Smooth Animations** ✨: Powered by **Anime.js** for engaging transitions and hover effects.
* **Interactive Charts** 📊: Built with **Chart.js** for clear, customizable data visualizations.
* **Robust Error Handling** ⚠️: User-friendly error messages for invalid inputs or API issues.

# **🛠️ Tech Stack**
This project demonstrates proficiency in a robust tech stack, blending front-end development with data science:

## **Front-End:**

* **HTML5**: Semantic, accessible structure.
* **CSS3**: Custom styling with gradients, animations, and responsive design.
* **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: Responsive grid and pre-styled components for rapid development.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Dynamic functionality, asynchronous API calls, and DOM manipulation.
* **Chart.js**: Interactive line charts for data visualization.
* **Anime.js**: Smooth animations for enhanced user experience.
* **Axios**: Efficient HTTP requests to the **YouTube Data API**.
* **Font Awesome**: Icons for visual enhancement.
* **Inter Font**: Modern typography for readability.

## **API:**

* **YouTube Data API v3**: Powers data retrieval for channel and video analytics.

# **🧠 Machine Learning & Data Science Skills**
This project applies data science and machine learning concepts in a client-side environment, showcasing:

* **Data Collection**: Fetching and processing data from the **YouTube Data API**.
* **Time Series Forecasting**: Implementing simplified **ARIMA** and **Prophet-like models** for view predictions.
* **Feature Engineering**: Calculating view rates and growth rates from raw data.
* **Statistical Analysis**: Computing averages, trends, and growth metrics.
* **Data Visualization**: Rendering insights with **Chart.js** for clear communication.
* **Error Handling**: Managing API errors and missing data gracefully.

**Note:** Due to client-side constraints, forecasting models are simplified. In a production environment, I would leverage Python libraries like `statsmodels` or `fbprophet` for more robust predictions, showcasing my adaptability to different tech stacks.

# **🚀 Getting Started**

## **Prerequisites**

* A **YouTube Data API Key** from the **Google Cloud Console**.
* A modern web browser (**Chrome, Firefox, Safari**, etc.).
* Basic familiarity with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## **Installation**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/youtube-views-predictor.git](https://github.com/your-username/youtube-views-predictor.git)
    cd youtube-views-predictor
    ```

2.  **Configure the API Key:**

    * Open `index.html` in a text editor.
    * Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your **YouTube Data API key**:
        ```javascript
        const YOUTUBE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY';
        ```

3.  **Run the Application:**

    * Open `index.html` directly in a browser or use a local server:
        ```bash
        npx http-server
        ```
    * Alternatively, deploy to **GitHub Pages** or any static hosting service.

## **Usage**

1.  Open the app via the **Live Demo**.
2.  Enter a **YouTube channel URL** (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/@ChannelName` or `https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC...`).
3.  Click **Analyze Channel** to view:
    * Channel stats (**subscribers, video count, total views**).
    * **7-day view predictions** (**ARIMA** and **Prophet models**).
    * Historical view trends in **interactive charts**.
    * A table of recent videos with view rates.

4.  Interact with charts and hover over elements for detailed insights.
